# Naive-Bayes-classifier

Based on Bayes' theorem, the naive bayes algorithm is a straightforward and effective classification technique. It is frequently utilized in machine learning applications for text classification. The assumption that all features are independent of one another, which may not always be the case in real-world circumstances, is what gives the algorithm its "naive" label.
